        <h2>What is CareerPath?</h2>
        <p>
            CareerPath is a student-focused career guidance platform designed to help you explore 
            career options that align with your personal preferences, working style, and interests.
            Instead of suggesting random careers, CareerPath analyzes how you prefer to work and 
            what truly interests you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many students choose careers based on pressure, trends, or incomplete information.
            CareerPath aims to reduce confusion by offering logical, structured, and personalized
            career recommendations.
